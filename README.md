# Detection of Nitrogen oxide Gas using Pristine, Defected &amp; (Copper, Gold, and Platinum) Doped Graphene sheet. The project is going to be published as a Research paper journal
## Abstract 
The goal of the work is to make the best version of Graphene as a Gas sensor to detect gas like Nitrogen Oxide (NO) using different types of transition metals (Cu/Gold/Platinum) doped into a Graphene sheet and creating a Single Vacancy(SV) in middle of Graphene sheet. Doped and defects are considered as a deformity in material that deteriorates its performance, however, at the Nano-scale level defects and doped lead to generating a useful and novel material for device application. In the present report, Pristine, Defected & doped Graphene sheets are being explored as a sensing material for toxic NO Gas. We designed Graphene devices with different cases for electrical I-V characteristics.
The sensing mechanism is studied with the help of its Electronic nature, Charge transfer, Adsorption Energy, Electrical Properties (I-V), and sensitivity.
## Implementation:
The Present work has been performed using density functional theory and non-equilibrium Greenâ€™s function (NEGF)  framework implemented through a quantum ATK -VNL.
To assess the sensing behavior of Graphene sheets towards NO Gas, its geometric structures, electronic and transport properties in pristine, Defected & doped Graphene sheets are being explored or studied before and after adsorption of NO gas can be used as a sensing material for toxic NO Gas.
The sensing mechanism is studied with the help of its Electronic nature, charge transfer, Density of State, Adsorption Energy, Electrical properties (I-V), Recovery time, and Sensitivity.
The electronic nature helps me to know conducting nature of Graphene sheets with different cases.
Charge transfer can be calculated by quantum ATK to know the mullicane population
Adsorption Energy
In graphene research, adsorption energy refers to the energy associated with the binding of an adsorbate (molecule, atom, or ion) to the surface of graphene. It is an important parameter that determines the stability and strength of the interaction between the adsorbate and the graphene surface [15].
For finding the sensing ability to detect the gases, we approached two methods that are computational and electrical I-V characteristic methods.
1. For the modeling of Graphene,32 carbon atom is considered in a single layer in 2-dimensional means a single atomic layer of graphite has been considered. A hexagonal supercell is kept periodic in the x and y directions during optimization. However, confined in the z-direction. This graphene is called pristine graphene. All the configurations are fully relaxed by optimizing the process till 0.01eV/Aforce and 0.01 eV/A stress. The K-Point sampling of (15,15,1) has been considered for accuracy with density cut-off 75 which is the density of the real space grid used for electrostatic calculation.
2. Transport calculations have been performed using NEGF formalism and the quasi-Newton method by considering a two-probe approach. We can use other electrode material electrode, but it is of high contact resistant and lattice mismatch so  A two probe model has been considered that is built, using fixed width graphene sheet extending in Z direction and forming the central region with the right (R) and left electrode(L) electrode region depicted in fig-

A large K point sampling of (1,1,100) has been considered in the calculation of accomplishing the accuracy in the transport property analysis. We applied five different voltage with the right and left electrode voltage from 0 to 1 voltage of interval 0.25 volt and got I-V sensing behavior.
Our approach to finding sensing behavior by comparing properties is to try first with pristine Graphene before and after NO adsorption and I-V characteristics. Doped and defective make noble material at the microelectronics level. 
## Analysis
In terms of formation energy, Pt-doped Graphene has been identified as the most stable sensor. However, when considering sensitivity and charge transfer, defective Graphene exhibits superior performance. The presence of defects in Graphene enhances its sensitivity toward external stimuli, making it a promising candidate for sensing applications. The defects introduce additional charge transfer pathways, leading to enhanced detection capabilities. Therefore, while Pt-doped Graphene excels in terms of stability, defective Graphene surpasses it in terms of sensitivity and charge transfer, making it a highly desirable material for achieving enhanced sensing performance. These findings contribute to the understanding and development of advanced sensing materials and devices for a range of applications. 
So finally, Gold doped Graphene shows better sensing with better sensing compared to pristine and other doped Graphene. Defected Graphene shows the best version of a sensor in our implementation. 
## Result
"I will attach and add each and every results and files after publishing as Research journel".It is now under process.

To evaluate the sensing behavior towards NO Gas, its geometric structures, and electronic and transport properties in pristine and doped (Cu/Au/Pt) states are studied before and after NO Gas adsorption.
The analysis is discussed in two sections, the first one is computational prediction and the second one is electrical I-V Characteristics.[(14,20)] Computational prediction indicates the best quality of sensing behavior of Graphene and Electrical I-V characteristic indicates the sensing behavior of Graphene towards harmful gases. The sensing mechanism is studied with the help of its Electronic nature, charge transfer, Density Of State, Formation Energy, Adsorption energy, Electrical properties (I-V), and Sensitivity.

The electronic nature of Graphene sheets [21] was investigated to determine their conducting properties under various conditions. Initially, the pristine Graphene was found to have a band gap of 0.058 at the quantum ATK tool; however, in reality, its band gap is nearly zero, indicating a quasi-semiconducting behavior. Subsequently, the Graphene sheets were exposed to NO Gas, resulting in metallic. The adsorption of NO Gas introduced localized states that altered the band structure of Graphene. The Adsorption Energy and sensitivity of Pristine Graphene is 0.77eV and 23 % which is very low for adsorbing NO Gas.

The Single Vacancy Carbon has been optimized to obtain the relaxed geometry with a C=C bond. In the given fig, the optimized defective Graphene sheet with top and side view with optimized NO gas. The vacancy defect shows a high 8.316 eV (Table 2) adsorption Energy with 51% sensitivity toward NO Gas, but its formation energy of 0.87 eV (in Table 1) shows its instability.
Defective graphene has emerged as a highly promising material for gas-sensing applications. Its unique properties make it an excellent candidate for detecting and quantifying various gases with high sensitivity and selectivity.
The introduction of defects in the graphene lattice significantly alters its electronic and chemical properties, rendering it sensitive to gas molecules. Defects create localized states or impurity levels that can interact with the target gases, leading to measurable changes in the electrical conductivity or optical properties of the graphene.
Gas sensors based on defective graphene can be fabricated using different techniques. Methods such as ion irradiation, chemical functionalization, or thermal treatment can induce structural or chemical defects, enhancing the gas-sensing capabilities of graphene. By carefully controlling the type and density of defects, the sensor's response to specific gases can be fine-tuned, enabling selective gas detection.
In terms of gas selectivity, defective graphene sensors can be tailored to detect specific gases of interest
Overall, defective graphene-based gas sensors hold great promise for gas sensing applications. With their high sensitivity, selectivity, and potential for miniaturization, they offer exciting prospects for a wide range of fields including environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and healthcare. Continued research and development in this area will likely lead to further advancements and practical applications of defective graphene gas sensors
